# Travel-time-optimizer

Following tutorial from : [NYCT - from A to Z with XGBoost (Tutorial)](https://www.kaggle.com/keerthanaksk/nyct-from-a-to-z-with-xgboost-tutorial)

I use this model to  predict traveling time between two coordinates in this project : [Sales MAP](https://github.com/dendiaryar/admin-sales-map)
